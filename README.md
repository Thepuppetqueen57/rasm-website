# RASM Website
 The [RASM](https://github.com/Thepuppetqueen57/rasm) website is made in rust using the macroquad library.

 Ik for this simple of a website I should've just used html, css, and js but I hate all of those so nuh uh.

# This was a terrible idea
 Making a website in macroquad was a terrible idea.

 Please don't make the same mistake I did.
